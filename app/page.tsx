            What Are HTTP Status Codes?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a web server in
            response to a client request. They indicate whether the request was
            successful, redirected, or resulted in an error. Every time your
            browser loads a page, makes an API call, or submits a form, the
            server responds with one of these codes along with the actual content.

            HTTP Status Code Categories
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Status codes are grouped into five categories based on their first
            digit:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <strong>1xx Informational</strong> — The server received the
              request and is continuing the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2xx Success</strong> — The request was successfully
              received, understood, and accepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3xx Redirection</strong> — Further action is needed to
              complete the request, usually a redirect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4xx Client Error</strong> — The request contains bad
              syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>5xx Server Error</strong> — The server failed to fulfill a
              valid request.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Most Common HTTP Status Codes
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While there are dozens of defined status codes, a handful appear far
            more frequently in everyday web development. <strong>200 OK</strong>{" "}
            means the request succeeded. <strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>{" "}
            tells the client the resource has a new URL. <strong>404 Not Found</strong>{" "}
            means the server cannot find the requested resource.{" "}
            <strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong> indicates something went
            wrong on the server side. Understanding these codes helps developers
            debug issues, configure proper redirects, and build better error
            handling in their applications.
